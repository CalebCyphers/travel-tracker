## Overview
Travel Tracker is a project meant to test learning front-end developer's skills regarding OOP, fetch requests, SASS, and other fundamentals. The website represents an interface that a user might use to book trips with a travel agency.

### Goals

* Gaining a better understanding of ES6 and test-driven-design. 
* Learning to use fetch requests and POST.
* Learning SASS functionality.
* Using OOP to deal with large datasets

## Design

  Design is meant to be clean and simple. I prefer minimalist, and I think it's best for readability and functionality. I wanted the user to be able to understand exactly what was going on, so there are few frills. Bootsrap was incredibly valuable for most of the basic styling and layout.

 ## Challenges  
 
There was some difficulty with trying to add new technologies through npm. Bootstrap's instructions on the website were easy: 'simply run `npm install bootstrap` in the terminal.' However, in the end, after numerous errors, I ended up conceding and linking to their online stylesheet in stead.

Working with dates was quite difficult. I was able to learn a lot about how the native Date object works in JS, and a classmate (Matt Lane) was kind enough to help me with setting up the `time.js` file which helped pave the road to the final product.

 ## Successes
 
I would say that my biggest success was finally grasping fetch and POST, and how they interact. It felt really amazing to successfully post something for the first time.
